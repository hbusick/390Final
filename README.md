Repository storing all work for the final paper of STOR 390 FA 24

The goal of this paper is to address the methods introduced by Heckman and colleagues (2023) of how to account for imperfect randomization in experiments. 

While this was a particularly challenging paper to digest, I sought to explain and analyze their methods in a way that streamlined processes and allowed me to consider normative questions regarding their methods.

I perform a novel analysis on simulated data that seeks to highlight for the time being we have ways of accounting for imperfect randomization, though not nearly as streamlined as they will likely become.

All code for the simulation can be found at the tail end of the .rmd in the Novel Analysis section. This code is supressed from appearing in the .pdf file, and is intertwined with the writing of the .rmd file.
